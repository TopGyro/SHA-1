SHA-1 Hashing Function created for an extra credit assignment
The hashing function performs a one way transformation and produces a 160-bit digest of the message.
Hashing functions in cyber security are used to verify data integrity.
SHA-1 however is prone to collision and a collision was detected by Google shattered. https://shattered.io
SHA-1 By Google's encryption standard is not viable and SHA-256 should be used.
If you are going to use this code please note this function is not meant to be used in cybersecurity purposes as neither the hashing function nor the coded imeplementation is intended to be subjected to vulnerabilities.
